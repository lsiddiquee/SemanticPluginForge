# Overview

`SemanticPluginForge` adds functionality to dynamically alter the metadata for SemanticKernel plugins. The key addition is the `IPluginMetadataProvider` interface. This enhancement allows for dynamic updates to plugin metadata, including descriptions, return value descriptions, and parameter descriptions, without the need for redeployment.

  - Supports a variety of use cases and future expansions.

- **Dynamic Tuning**:
  - Fine-tune plugin descriptions and parameters based on evolving requirements or user feedback.
  - Quickly respond to changes in business logic or user expectations without interrupting service availability.
